With TEE-based bridges, you do need to trust the hardware manufacturer (Intel, AMD, etc.) to properly implement the secure enclaves. However, the X402 protocol addresses this through a hybrid security approach: we combine TEE security with multiple cryptographic verification layers and economic security. This creates what we call 'defense-in-depth trustlessness'—where even if one security layer is compromised, others remain intact. For users who prioritize absolute trustlessness, we also support fully decentralized sBTC bridges that rely solely on cryptographic verification. The optimal approach depends on your specific security requirements and risk tolerance, which is why we support both models within our protocol."

This process involves generating cryptographic proofs that can be validated across different blockchain networks.\n\nAttestation in the X402 context works in three key steps:\n\n1. Measurement: When the TEE or bridge node is initialized, it measures the code and environment configuration. These measurements, including hash values of the software, transaction verification code, and network configuration, are securely recorded.\n\n2. Signing: The measurements are then signed by a certificate, typically issued by a trusted authority or hardware manufacturer. This step ensures that the attestation output can be cryptographically verified by external systems.\n\n3. Cross-Chain Verification: The bridge generates a cryptographic report (attestation) that includes the signed measurements. This report is then verified on both source and destination blockchains through smart contracts, ensuring that the bridge environment is legitimate before any cross-chain asset transfers are permitted.\n\nThis attestation process is critical for cross-chain security, as it ensures that the software handling sensitive operations like key management and transaction verification hasn't been compromised, helping to build trust between different blockchain networks and their users."
