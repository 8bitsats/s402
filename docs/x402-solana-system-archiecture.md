# X402 Solana: System Archiecture

## SolPay402: Solana-Based x402 Protocol

### System Architecture Overview

SolPay402 is an implementation of the x402 protocol for Solana, enabling instant HTTP-native payments with USDC, SOL, and other Solana-based tokens. The system consists of several core components working together to provide seamless, trustless payments between clients (including AI agents) and service providers.

### Core Components

#### 1. HTTP Protocol Layer

* **402 Response Handler**: Implements the HTTP 402 status code for payment requests
* **Payment Header Processor**: Processes X-PAYMENT headers containing encoded payment information
* **Response Verifier**: Verifies and processes X-PAYMENT-RESPONSE headers

#### 2. Solana Integration Layer

* **Transaction Builder**: Constructs and signs Solana transactions
* **Account Manager**: Manages keypairs and wallet connections
* **RPC Interface**: Communicates with Solana nodes for transaction submission and verification
* **Token Manager**: Handles USDC, SOL, and other SPL token transactions

#### 3. Payment Facilitation Service

* **Transaction Validator**: Validates payment payloads
* **Settlement Engine**: Ensures on-chain settlement of payments
* **Fee Calculator**: Dynamically calculates network fees
* **Receipt Generator**: Generates cryptographic receipts for completed transactions

#### 4. AI Agent Swarm

* **Financial Coordinator**: Orchestrates the agent swarm's economic activities
* **Payment Agents**: Specialized agents that handle payment processing
* **Discovery Agents**: Find services and negotiate payments
* **Spending Policy Agents**: Enforce budgeting and spending limitations
* **Accounting Agents**: Track expenditures and maintain financial records

#### 5. Integration Interfaces

* **Helio SDK**: Integration with Helio for Solana infrastructure
* **Solana Pay Adapter**: Compatibility layer with existing Solana Pay infrastructure
* **Shopify Plugin**: E-commerce integration for merchant services
* **Developer API**: SDK for service providers to implement SolPay402

### System Flow

1. Client (human or AI agent) makes HTTP request to a service
2. Service returns 402 Payment Required with payment details
3. Client constructs payment payload with Solana transaction
4. Payment Facilitator validates and settles transaction on Solana
5. Service grants access to requested resource
6. Client receives resource and payment confirmation

### Security Considerations

* **Non-custodial Design**: Facilitator cannot move funds without client authorization
* **Signature Verification**: All transactions require cryptographic signatures
* **Rate Limiting**: Protection against DDoS attacks
* **Failure Recovery**: Graceful handling of network failures
* **Replay Protection**: Prevention of transaction replay attacks

### Agent Swarm Architecture

The AI agent swarm operates as a distributed autonomous organization with specialized roles:

* **Manager Agents**: Coordinate overall swarm activities and resource allocation
* **Financial Agents**: Handle budgeting, payments, and financial decision-making
* **Service Agents**: Interface with external APIs and services
* **Utility Agents**: Provide support functions to other agents
* **Learning Agents**: Optimize swarm performance based on historical data

Each agent communicates through a shared protocol, enabling complex collaborative behaviors while maintaining individual responsibilities.
